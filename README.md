# Predicting_Income

**Contributors: Cameron Stewart, Michael Mazel, Rick Fontenot and Tricia Herrera**

>Does marital status affect income? What is the likelihood that a 32-year-old white married male will make more than $50K a year compared to a 59-year-old black divorced female? An individual's income may be influenced by certain factors, and this study examines those factors individually and collectively to determine whether they do have an effect. Using U.S. Census Data, we predict whether an individual will make more or less than $50K a year in the U.S. in 1994. By using each modelâ€™s AUC against the test set, we can determine if one model methodology outperforms another in predicting income. The models will select a cutoff that balances accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.
